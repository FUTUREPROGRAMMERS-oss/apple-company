<P><SPAN>A B O U T</SPAN>             Apple, based in Cupertino, CA, is one of 
the most valuable companies in the world. It produces popular digital gadgets, 
including Macs, iPods, iPhones, and iPads. The company was founded in 1976 by 
two young hackers, Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak. Its second product, the Apple 
II, was the first personal computer to achieve mass-market success. The 
Macintosh, released in 1984, introduced the modern graphical user interface to 
the mainstream. What was the Apple II? The Apple II was the first personal 
computer to achieve significant commercial success. It was designed in 1977 by 
Steve Wozniak, a brilliant 26-year-old engineer with a knack for packing a lot 
of functionality into a small and affordable package. What is a Macintosh? The 
Macintosh, or Mac, is a line of personal computers Apple has sold since 1984. 
The original Macintosh was the first commercially successful computer to use a 
graphical user interface (GUI) based on a mouse. It cost $2495, or about $5700 
in 2014 dollars. The basic ideas of the Macintosh interface — windows, menus, 
icons, and the like — were developed at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center in 
the 1970sHow did Steve Jobs turn Apple around? When Steve Jobs took the reins at 
Apple in 1997, the company was in tough shape. It had a bewildering array of 
products, no clear strategy, and was losing tens of millions of dollars every 
quarter.             </P><IMG width="300" height="500" src="" text-align="center">

<P><SPAN>SERVICES</SPAN>                        Although the question was 
difficult to find his answer, one of the users of the quora network had a 
logical and very important answer as he stated that what distinguishes Apple and 
its products is not the strength that is available to them or the design and 
shape that characterizes it, but rather that distinguishes Apple products from 
the rest. The company's other products are synchronization between them, where 
you can for example run an application on the iPhone and leave it to complete 
what you were doing on the iPhone through an Apple watch or move to a computer 
for your Mac to find the same activities that you did in sync with the computer 
and so on ..                         </P><IMG width="300" height="300" src="">
